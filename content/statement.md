# Problem Statement

Startups need to keep costs lean while simultaneously delivering an accessible a product, ready for scale. However, **accessibility is often neglected** --- relegated as a set of secondary tasks put on already overworked product and engineering teams.

## This Manifests As:

- Incomplete documentation rendered unusable by implementation experts, support, and endusers
- Splintered knowledge repositories with duplicate files and no source of truth
- Irregular feature naming and descriptions across your website, product, ads, and resources
- Product expertise that can (and often does) walk out the door with a new job offer
- Premature releases unsupported by enablement assets
- Wasteful, duplicative projects and tasks helmed by different departments

# The Underlying Costs

Startups forego hiring knowledge experts to save a few bucks---at least, until they lose their first whale prospect over the inability to integrate with the product's API. Or worse, they experience a spike in churn directly related to poor product adoption and a total lack of enablement resources.

By the time you've scaled to realize this costly problem, however, onboarding a technical writer and empowering them to build the departmental in-roads required to resolve the core issue is nothing short of a heroic feat. Poor habits have already crystalized, and getting proper buy-in for knowledge initiatives often fails due to improperly defined ownership realms. (_Who owns the documentation enough to approve needed changes: Product, Support, Engineering? All three?_)  

This results in months going by without meaningful structural improvements, all-the-while you're losing next-level prospects and having to eat the cost of heavy-handed implementations that could have otherwise been self-serviced.

The price of neglecting a knowledge strategy is far higher than hiring an expert early on. **Knowledge is one of your products**. The sooner you realize that, the more competitive your product suite will become.
