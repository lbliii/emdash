## Pillar Pages

Pillar pages are large, authoritative content pieces that covers a major topic and its key sub-topics. This content is usually higher level and is discovered by readers looking to quickly become intermediately acquainted with a tool, process, or new skill.

Pillar pages gain rank over time by offering a unique, authoritative perspective that is sharable, scannable, and well-organized.

## Cluster Articles

Cluster articles build a web of support around pillar pages by offering in-depth looks at topics briefly considered in the larger body of work. Traffic between the two should flow interchangably using well-placed, natural crosslinks.

## Release Blogs

Large releases involving net-new products, features, or massive overhauls deserve more than just a few lines in your release notes. Release blogs give existing customers an extra heads-up on what's new and how things have changed. This content also inspires confidence in prospects looking for regular updates to the product.

## Landing Page Copy

Landing page copy should clearly define a product, its features, or their combined use case. It tells a story that solves your buyer persona's problems in a succinct way. It's both empathetic and informational, routing to further resources that drill into the nitty-gritty; also includes a call-to-action, such as signing up for a free trial.
