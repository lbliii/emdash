# About 

## Our Origin Story

Emdash (**Emdash Tech LLC**) is a digital experience agency that began in the fall of 2020. Our founder, Lawrence, has spent the past 5 years delivering content to tech startups across industries such as FinTech, DevOps, eCommerce, and Legal. 

Along the way, he realized that there was a huge need for outsourced technical content creators at startups that weren't ready (or even thinking about) building dedicated internal teams for ux writing, technical writing, and product marketing.

## What is Digital Experience? 

Think of it as the personality of your brand and products. The way your product interacts with a user is just as important as what it can do for them; in fact, your best brand evangelist is actually the text your users consume across every surface of your product --- including web pages and documentation. 

## Tech We Love Using 

Content has evolved beyond WYSWIG solutions like Wordpress, which intermingles text with site styling and gains friction over time to maintain. Today you can build publication toolchains that are collaborative, low cost, secure, and scale with your organization without getting trapped by any one vendor.
